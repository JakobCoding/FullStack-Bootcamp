**How to make learning to code a habit:**

- Get a calendar and draw a straight line through everyday to create a snake effect. After a few days you realise you've created a streak and you won't want to break that line, becuase how hard is it to do just one more day.

- Break learning down into small chuncks, 1 hour per day everyday is better than 10 hours on the weekend once a fortnight. Not only will you retain information better through repetition but you are forming the basis of a habit, and before long it doesn't feel like a chore anymore.

**Create a Portfolio**

One of the most important things when getting hired as a web developer or programmer is your portfolio. Employer's will be looking to see what your made of, what your capabilities are and what you can do and all of that can be displayed using a great portfolio website.
